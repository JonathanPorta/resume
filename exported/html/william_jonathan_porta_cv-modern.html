        <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>I am passionate about the user experience. I think of myself first as a user, and secondly as a developer. I thrive on the marriage of exceptional design, solid functionality and reliability. Most recently, I have been stoked about Machine Learning, Rails, React, Go and Continuous Integration. I have a long-standing love for Kubernetes, test driven development, tinkering with electronics and embedded processors, and building games in Unity3D. When I am away from my workstation you can find me fixing-up old houses, or tearing apart old vehicles.</p>
